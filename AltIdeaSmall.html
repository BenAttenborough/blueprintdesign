'<p>Just because one is travelling, one should not have to compromise on quality.this has always been our premise when designing and making travel games.</p>'+
'<p>From the days when the venerable Venice Simplon Orient Express back in the Seventies requested that we produce a range of games to reflect their customers’ standing, taste and demands, we simply looked to our full size games and “down-sized” them, to use a modern day term.</p>'+
'<p>This of course is not always the most cost effective way of presenting items to the market, where there is much competition and many who are not normally in the “gaming” business, think that this is just another piece of giftware. This is not the case, the games must work or they are useless. So once the quality materials have been selected and sourced our design team look to the failing of other sets on the market, whether it be large intrusive locks or catches, which would get caught on ones expensive clothing when travelling, or ridiculously small playing pieces which are difficult to pick up – one’s hands do not get smaller when we travel! Also when we are making a board that can offer more games than just one for very little extra cost, weight or size; then it should be added to enhance the product and our customer’s perception of quality and value.</p>'+
'<p>Within this range which is currently being re-worked to include printed leather playing boards which will reduce costs and offer a larger possible range of options for customisation and different design aspects, we offer the classic games Chess, Backgammon, Draughts (or Checkers) plus a small travel compendium within our Compact Travel Backgammon (# 83GC) and even a full size travel set for the serious Chess and Backgammon player (# 87/ S & F / CS), which both retain fully hand inlaid playing fields.</p>'+
'<p>Soon to be added to this collection will be two Backgammon Roll-ups paying special attention to the players needs so often missed by other such sets.please watch this space.</p>');
